# ClimateMedia
Space for all python and csv files associated with statistical calculations for 2023 Climate Media project

This is an Interactive Python Notebook, powered by Jupyter Notebook. In order to access these coding cells, which is where you can type in the functions you desire, you need to download progams like Python, VSCode, and/or Jupyter Notebook to your computer (if they aren't downloaded there already)

This link will take you to a Colby Computer Science webpage with detailed instructions on how to download Python, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, etc.

Make sure you follow every step of the instructions from L1-L3 on that webpage, because all of the modules are needed to access the data.

Now that everything is installed onto your computer, you can access the cells on this notebook. There are two kinds of cellsâ€”Markdown and Python. The Markdown cells only contain text that you can manipulate. The coding cells (the ones that say Python on the bottom right) are the ones where you can input the different variables for the functions.

To run one of the coding cells, you can either press the triangular play button that is on the left-hand side of the cell (it appears once you hover over it). Or, you can click onto the coding cell and press SHIFT + ENTER. Either will run the cell and all of the code it contains.

Try it with the cell below, which loads the filmnames and coding data into the Stats class, which is where all of the functions will run. If you do not already have it, message me for a copy of all the data and csv files needed to run this program. You should make sure the folder has the files that end with a .py, and that there is a sub-folder there with files that end with .csv. Or you can get them from the github page, and see the standard file placement:
