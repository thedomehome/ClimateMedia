# ClimateMedia
Space for all python and csv files associated with statistical calculations for 2023 Climate Media project

This link will take you to a Colby Computer Science webpage with detailed instructions on how to download Python, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, etc.

Make sure you follow every step of the instructions from L1-L3 on that webpage, because all of the modules are needed to access the data.

Now that everything is installed onto your computer, you can access the cells on the notebooks. 

There are three kinds of files in the repository: Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and CSV files.

.ipynb files: these are the interactive <Jupyter Notebook> files where you can change the variables and find out specific calculations.

.py files: these are the files with functions and data processing directions. Only go into/change the code here if there is an error.

.csv files: these contain the data which is to be processed. You can control how many of the data imported files are included in the calculations, but by default, I included all of the .csv files as of August 16, 2023.

Download this repository into your computer and set up the folders in the correct manner as you see in the repository.

Below are specific instructions for interacting with the .ipynb files:

There are two kinds of cells—Markdown and Python. The Markdown cells only contain text that you can manipulate. The coding cells (the ones that say Python on the bottom right) are the ones where you can change the strings which contain the different variables for the functions.

To run one of the coding cells, you can either press the triangular play button that is on the left-hand side of the cell (it appears once you hover over it). Or, you can click onto the coding cell and press SHIFT + ENTER. Either will run the cell and all of the code it contains.
